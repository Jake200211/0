#Synopsis

This final project is a fun text based adventure that is somewhat difficult and that can entertain older people.

#Code Example

What you will be doing with this code is choosing what the character, Ryan Pierce, does.  For example, you get to choose whether he turns left or right at a fork in the hallway.

#Motivation

My motivation for this project was mainly that I had to because it was a part of my class, but I also chose to do this project because I thought it would be quite fun to create and to watch it unfold.

#Installation

What you must do is download the .java file and run it in a program that accepts .java files.

#Contributors

The only contributor to this project was myself, but I did get some fantastic ideas for the story line from the notorious Cooter Gale.

#Twitter

Also... ya'll should follow my Twitter since apparently putting it here is a good idea.
